# osbMangaReader
Progressive Web App for reading Manga, powered by [MangaScraper API](https://market.mashape.com/doodle/manga-scraper) with content powered by [MangaReader.net](https://www.mangareader.net) (for now, will expand to other sources later). At the moment I am working on the Bookmarking system to allow users to jump around bookmarked pages within a Manga, I am also looking to create a wrapper in Electron to create a desktop application.
