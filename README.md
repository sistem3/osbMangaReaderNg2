# osbMangaReader
Javscript Web Component for reading Manga, powered by [https://market.mashape.com/doodle/manga-scraper](MangaScraper API) with content powered by [https://www.mangareader.net](MangaReader.net) (for now, will expand to other sources later). At the moment I am working on the Bookmarking system to allow users to jump around bookmarked pages within a Manga, I am also looking to create a wrapper in Electron to create a desktop application.

_Please note this project is still in an experimental phase_
